### Point 1

I searched Google for some common steps in a CI setup in Python because I love Python as it was my first programming language I've ever learn, and actually found cool stuff in Goolge, most of them are talking about how to create a CI for Python, this [one](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/python-continuous-integration-continuous-delivery) and also this [one](https://realpython.com/python-continuous-integration/) are cool, it goes in baby steps to build your first pipeline in Python, I don't have Python installed in my machine also not that professional in Python so I didn't do this operations just read the articles to try to understand the main concepts in the whole CI setup, and part 11a is clear enough to define some important concepts and I understand it for now.

### Point 2

There are alternativesto GitHub Actions and Jenkins like CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, Buildkite, GitLab, Trello and more, there is more info in this [site](https://stackshare.io/github-actions/alternatives).

### Point 3

About chosing between self-hosted vs cloud-based environment and why, well [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ci-cd-comparison-using-managed-providers-vs-self-hosting) article is good and makes some cons and pros between both of them and helping to chose one of them, this actually depending on organizationâ€™s unique requirements, budget, and administration bandwidth to let you decide what is perfect for you.
